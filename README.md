A cross-platform movie recommendation mobile app made using React native and Expo with free TMDB API. I used expo go app to create it live on my phone. You can check the screenshots in the image given below:

This is my first mobile app that I learnt to make with react native expo project. I learned it from JSMastery youtube tutorial. The link of the tutorial is given <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z9JyB2EIE">here</a>.

## Key Concepts

Following are key concepts that I learned and implemented into this app

- Reusable react components
- File routes and folder structure
- Navigation with expo Router
- Setup nativewind for styling
- Integrate REST API(TMDB)
- Custom hook to fetch data
- Using third-party node packages
- Built-in react native & expo components
